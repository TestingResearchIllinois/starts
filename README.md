# STARTS (*STA*tic *R*egression *T*est *S*election) Overview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TestingResearchIllinois/starts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TestingResearchIllinois/starts)

STARTS is a tool for static class-level regression test selection tool
for Maven-based Java programs.

## Prerequisites

1. Java 1.8
2. Maven 3.2.5 and above
3. Maven Surefire 2.14 and above
4. Operating System: Linux or OSX

## Integrating STARTS Plugin from Maven Central

Change the pom.xml to add the configuration for the STARTS plugin:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>edu.illinois</groupId>
      <artifactId>starts-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.3</version>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

## Building STARTS from source

1. `git clone https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/starts`
2. `cd starts`
3. `mvn install`

## Using the STARTS Maven Plugin

### Available Options

1. To see all the goals that STARTS provides, run `mvn starts:help`
2. To see the details for any of the goals, run `mvn starts:help -Ddetail=true -Dgoal=<goal>`;
 replace `<goal>` with the goal of interest.

### Major Functionality

1. To see the **types** that changed since the last time STARTS was run:
`mvn starts:diff`

2. To see the **types** that may be impacted by changes since the last
time STARTS was run: `mvn starts:impacted`

3. To see the **tests** that are affected by the most recent changes:
`mvn starts:select`

4. To perform RTS using STARTS (i.e., select tests and run the
selected tests): `mvn starts:starts`

5. To remove all artifacts that STARTS stores between versions
(i.e. in the `.starts` directories): `mvn starts:clean`

__NOTE:__ By default, commands (1) - (3) *will not* update the
checksums of files in the latest version, while the command in (4)
*will* update the checksums of the files. Each command has a
`update**Checksums` option that can be used to change the default
behavior. For example, to update the checksums while checking the
diff, run `mvn starts:diff -DupdateDiffChecksums=true`.
